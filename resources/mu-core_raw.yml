spells:
  - name: Animate Dead
    level: 5
    range: touch
    duration: special
    reference: BF 17
    description: >
      This spell turns the bones or bodies of dead creatures into
      undead skeletons or zombies that follow the caster's spoken
      commands. They remain animated until they are destroyed. The
      caster may animate a number of hit dice of undead equal to twice
      his or her caster level, and no more. Animated skeletons have
      hit dice equal to the number the creature had in life; for
      skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one hit die,
      regardless of the character level of the deceased. Zombies
      have one more hit die than the creature had in life. An
      animated skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact
      skeleton; a zombie can be created only from a mostly intact
      corpse. The caster must touch the remains to be animated. No
      character may normally control more hit dice of undead than
      4 times his or her level, regardless of how many times this
      spell is cast.
  - name: Anti-Magic Shell
    level: 6
    range: 10' radius
    duration: 1 turn/level
    reference: BF 17
    description: >
      Within a 10' radius around the caster, all magic is negated
      for the full duration of the spell. Magical attacks will not
      affect the caster, magic items and spells within the radius
      are suppressed, and the caster cannot perform further magic
      until the spell has expired.
  - name: Charm Monster
    level: 4
    range: 30'
    duration: special
    reference: BF 18
    description: >
      This spell functions like charm person, except that the
      effect is not restricted by creature type or size. Undead
      monsters are unaffected. This spell can affect 3d6 hit dice
      of creatures of 3 or fewer hit dice, or one creature of more
      than 3 hit dice. Saving throws are made just as for charm
      person.
  - name: Charm Person
    level: 1
    range: 30'
    duration: special
    reference: BF 18
    description: >
      This spell makes a humanoid creature of 4 hit dice or less
      regard the caster as its trusted friend and ally. Humans
      and demi-humans may be affected, regardless of level of
      ability. A save vs. Spells will negate the effect. If the
      creature is currently being threatened or attacked by the
      caster or his or her allies, it receives a +5 bonus on its
      saving throw. The spell does not enable the caster to
      control the charmed person as if it were an automaton;
      rather, it perceives his or her words and actions in the most
      favorable way. The caster can try to give the subject
      orders, but it will not do anything it wouldn’t ordinarily do,
      and further may receive an additional saving throw to
      overcome the magic (at the GM's discretion). The caster
      must speak the target's language to communicate any
      commands, or else be good at pantomiming; of course, if
      the caster is attacked, the charmed creature will act to
      protect its “friend” (though that could mean attacking the
      caster's enemies, or attempting to carry off the caster to a
      “safe” place). The target receives a new saving throw
      each day if it has an Intelligence of 13 or greater, every
      week if its Intelligence is 9-12, or every month if its
      Intelligence is 8 or less.
  - name: Clairvoyance
    level: 3
    range: 60'
    duration: 12 turns
    reference: BF 18
    description: >
      This spell enables the caster to see into another area
      through the eyes of a living creature in that area. The
      caster must specify the direction and approximate
      distance, up to a maximum of 60' away. If there is no
      appropriate creature in that area, the spell fails. No saving
      throw is allowed, and the target creature is unaware that it
      is being so used. The caster may choose another subject
      creature after at least a turn has passed, enabling multiple
      locations to be viewed. If the subject creature moves out
      of range, contact is lost, though the caster may be able to
      choose another target in this case.
  - name: Cloudkill
    level: 5
    range: 100' + 10'/level
    duration: 6 rounds/level
    reference: BF 18
    description: >
      This spell creates a 20'x20'x20' cloud of poison gas which
      moves at a rate of 10' per round under the control of the
      caster (so long as he or she concentrates on it). The gas
      kills outright any creatures of 3 or fewer hit dice or levels it
      comes in contact with; creatures having 4 or more hit dice
      or levels must save vs. Poison or die. The cloud persists
      for the entire duration even if the caster ceases to
      concentrate upon it.
  - name: Confusion
    level: 4
    range: 360'
    duration: 2 rounds + 1/level
    reference: BF 18
    description: >
      This spell causes up to 3d6 living creatures within a 30'
      radius circle around the target point to become confused,
      making them unable to independently determine what
      they will do. A saving throw vs. Spells is allowed to resist
      the effect. Roll on the following table on each subject’s
      Initiative number each round to see what the subject does.

      <table>
      <tr><th>d20</th><th>Behavior</th></tr>
      <tr><td>1-2</td><td>Attack caster with melee or ranged weapons (or close with caster if attack is not possible).</td></tr>
      <tr><td>3-4</td><td>Act normally.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>5-10</td><td>Do nothing but babble incoherently.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>11-14</td><td>Flee away from caster at top possible speed.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>15-20</td><td>Attack nearest creature.</td></tr>
      </table>

      A confused character who can’t carry out the indicated
      action does nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers are
      not at any special advantage when attacking a confused
      character. Any confused character who is attacked
      automatically retaliates on its next turn, as long as it is still
      confused when its turn comes.
  - name: Conjure Elemental
    level: 4
    range: 240'
    duration: special
    reference: BF 18
    description: >
      A portal to one of the Elemental Planes of Air, Earth, Fire,
      or Water is opened, allowing the Magic-User to summon
      an elemental from that plane. At most one elemental of
      each type may be summoned by the caster in a given day.
      Once the elemental appears, it serves the conjurer
      indefinitely, provided the caster concentrates on nothing
      but controlling the creature; spell casting, combat, or
      movement over half the normal rate results in loss of
      concentration. The conjurer, while in control of an
      elemental, can dismiss it to its native plane at will (doing so
      on his or her Initiative if in combat). If the Magic-User
      loses concentration, control of the summoned Elemental is
      lost and cannot be regained. The creature then seeks to
      attack the conjurer and all others in its path. Only dispel
      magic or dispel evil will banish the elemental once control
      has been lost. An elemental may, of course, choose to
      return to its home plane on its own; such creatures will not
      choose to remain on the material plane for long.
