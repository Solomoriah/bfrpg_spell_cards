The clearer the mental image, the more likely it is that the teleportation will work. Areas of strong magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.</p> <p>To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the table below. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.</p> <table> <tr> <th>Familiarity</th> <th>On Target</th> <th>Off Target</th> <th>Similar Area</th> <th>Mishap</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Very familiar</td> <td>01&#8211;97</td> <td>98&#8211;99</td> <td>100</td> <td>&#8212;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Studied carefully</td> <td>01&#8211;94</td> <td>95&#8211;97</td> <td>98&#8211;99</td> <td>100</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Seen casually</td> <td>01&#8211;88</td> <td>89&#8211;94</td> <td>95&#8211;98</td> <td>99&#8211;100</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Viewed once</td> <td>01&#8211;76</td> <td>77&#8211;88</td> <td>89&#8211;96</td> <td>97&#8211;100</td> </tr> <tr> <td>False destination</td> <td>&#8212;</td> <td>&#8212;</td> <td>81&#8211;92</td> <td>93&#8211;100</td> </tr> </table> <p>Familiarity: &#8220;Very familiar&#8221; is a place where the caster has been very often and feels at home. &#8220;Studied carefully&#8221; is a place the caster knows well, either because it can currently be seen, the caster has been there often, or other means (such as scrying) have been used to study the place for at least one hour. &#8220;Seen casually&#8221; is a place that the caster has seen more than once but with which he or she is not very familiar. &#8220;Viewed once&#8221; is a place that the caster has seen once, possibly using magic.</p> <p>&#8220;False destination&#8221; is a place that does not truly exist or if the caster is teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar. When rolling on this row, use 1d20+80.</p> <p>On Target: The caster appears exactly where desired.</p> <p>Off Target: The caster appears safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly.</p> <p>Similar Area: The caster winds up in an area that&#8217;s visually or thematically similar to the target area. This means that the caster appears in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell&#8217;s range, the spell simply fails instead.</p> <p>Mishap: The caster and anyone else teleporting with the caster have gotten &#8220;scrambled.&#8221; Each takes 1d10 points of damage; then reroll on the chart to see where they wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time &#8220;Mishap&#8221; comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.</p> ",

If the caster so desires, the wall can bond itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. The wall must always be a flat plane, though the edges can be shaped to fit the available space, and it must always be conjured in contact with the ground.</p> <p>The caster can increase the thickness of the wall with a proportionate reduction in the area; for example, doubling the thickness halved the area. The wall may not be made less than one inch thick. The caster can create the wall vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left un-pushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature with 13 Strength (or 4 or more Hit Dice) can push the wall over; or several creatures can work together to do so. (If the optional Ability Roll rule is being used, a Strength roll at -3 is sufficient to topple the wall.) Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful saves vs. Death Ray (with Dexterity bonus added). Any creature of Ogre-size or smaller that fails the save takes 10d6 points of damage. The wall cannot crush larger creatures.</p> <p>Like any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and other natural phenomena.</p> ",

These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears; within this limitation, the caster may choose any arrangement of webs he or she wishes, up to the limit of range and the given 8,000 cubic foot volume. The caster may choose to create a smaller volume if he or she wishes. Creatures caught within a web become entangled among the gluey fibers. Attacking a creature in a web won&#8217;t cause the attacker to become entangled, but moving through the affected area will.</p> <p>Anyone in the area of effect when the spell is cast must make a save vs. Death Ray. If this save succeeds, the creature is entangled, but not prevented from moving, though moving is reduced to one-half normal movement rate. Such entangled creatures may not cast spells or perform normal attacks; whether other actions are possible is left to the GM to decide. Once an entangled creature leaves the area of effect of the web, it will be able to act normally again.</p> <p>If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can&#8217;t move or perform any other physical action. Speech remains possible, however. Creatures with Strength of 13 or higher (or 4 or more hit dice) may be able to break loose, however; each round, such creatures are allowed another save vs. Death Ray with results as given above. Creatures failing the initial save and having Strength of 12 or less (or fewer than 4 hit dice) are trapped until the duration expires or the webs are otherwise removed.</p> <p>The strands of a web spell are flammable. Any fire can set the webs alight and burn away a 10' cube in 1 round; the fire will spread to adjacent 10' cubes each round until all the webbing is consumed (or the fire is put out by some means). All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames, but if they survive they are completely free afterwards.</p> ",
